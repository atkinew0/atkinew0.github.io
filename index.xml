      <description>I am a lawyer, programmer and foreign language learner (Japanese, Spanish, French, and a little Russian and Chinese). I plan to write about my thoughts and projects making automated tools to learn programming languages, and whatever else pops into my head. Contact me at atkinson.eli@gmail.com</description>

      <description>Studying and using foreign languages for most of my career may have skewed the lense I look at learning anything through, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that programmers, who frequently find themselves having to learn new language and concepts could benefit from many techniques and methods developed for second language acquisition. I plan to explore tools and ideas for making learning programming easier in this series of posts.
One objection that I imagine many programmers might have to the suggestion learning programming should be anything like learning a second language is that learning programming is primarily about understanding the concepts whereas language learning is more about rote memorization of vocabulary items.</description>
